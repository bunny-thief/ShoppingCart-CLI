## Exercise: ArrayList Shopping List

### Objective:

Practice basic ArrayList operations by creating a simple shopping list.

### Description:

You are tasked with creating a program to manage a shopping list using an ArrayList. The program should allow users to add items to the list, remove items, display the current list, and exit the program.

### Guidelines:

1.	Create an ArrayList to store shopping items (strings).
2.	Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
3.	Add an item
4.	Remove an item
5.	Display the list
6.	Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

- To add an item, take input from the user and add it to the ArrayList.
- To remove an item, take input (item name) from the user and remove it from the ArrayList.
- To display the list, iterate through the ArrayList and print each item.
- To exit, terminate the program.
- Handle input validation to prevent errors when removing items and handling menu options.
